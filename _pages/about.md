I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey’s leading
technical university, with a cumulative GPA of 3.02 under the advisory of
[Prof. Dr. Tahir Cetin Akinci](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/tahircea).
I was employed as a Data Scientist at Hepsiburada, Turkey’s
leading e-Commerce platform, and I bring a strong foundation in data analytics and machine
learning. Notably, I am a graduate student at Koç University, Turkey’s leading research
center, and a research member at [GGLab](https://gglab-ku.github.io) led by [Asst. Prof. Dr. Gozde Gul Sahin](https://gozdesahin.github.io), focusing on
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications. During my first year, I worked on
long context LLMs and since the summer of 2024, I have been working on Decentralized
Training of Multilingual LLMs with Federated Learning settings using Flower framework. I
also have experience with computer vision models. This unique blend of academic pursuit
and practical experience positions me to contribute effectively to your team’s objectives. I am
looking for Ph.D. and research positions where I can learn from your team and also
contribute to it in the field of artificial intelligence, since having an electrical engineering
bachelor degree and a computer science master degree enlightened my vision and improved
my abilities in various research areas.
